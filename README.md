The purpose of the project is to implement the kernel perceptron algorithm to address a multi-class classification problem.
With perceptron, the learning is performed in online fashion. The learner accesses training examples one at a time, and updates the parameters of the classifier on the basis of mistakes made on observed data. As a result of the training process, the algorithm generates a sequence of binary classifiers. Depending on the method followed to extract the final predictor for binary classification, several variations of the Perceptron algorithm can be adopted. 
In our analysis we consider three implementations of Kernel Perceptron:
- Vanilla Kernel Perceptron
- ERM Kernel Peceptron
- Averaged Kernel Perceptron
